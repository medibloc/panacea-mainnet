  voting period of the SoftwareUpgrade proposal ends with the `passed` status.
    - See countdown [here](https://www.mintscan.io/medibloc/blocks/10196856).
- Upgrade type: Soft-fork

## Guides for Validators and Full-Node Operators

If this SoftwareUpgrade proposal is approved, the state machine of the `panacead` will be stopped as soon as the chain
reaches to the block height 10196856.
It means that new blocks will not be produced until the `panacead` daemon is restarted with the new version.

When the state machine is stopped, you will be able to see the following error logs:

```
ERR UPGRADE "v2.0.7" NEEDED at height: 10196856:
ERR CONSENSUS FAILURE!!! err="UPGRADE \"v2.0.7\" NEEDED at height: 10196856: "
```

Then, stop your process.

```bash
pkill panacead

# or by other commands depending on your environment
```

After that, you should build a new binary as below. And, please replace the old `panacead` binary with the new one.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/medibloc/panacea-core
cd panacea-core
git checkout v2.0.7
make install

panacead version
# should print v2.0.7
```

Prior to the upgrade, validators are encouraged to take a full data snapshot. Snapshotting depends heavily on
infrastructure, but generally this can be done by backing up the `~/.panacea` directory as below.<br>
**IMPORTANT**: It is critically important for validator operators to back-up
the `~/.panacea/data/priv_validator_state.json` file after stopping the `panacead` process. This file is updated every
block as your validator participates in consensus rounds. It is a critical file needed to prevent double-signing, in
case the upgrade fails and the previous chain needs to be restarted.

```bash
cp -R ~/.panacea ~/panacea-3-v2.0.6-backup

# or, to the external storage
```

Then, you can start the `panacead` again.

```bash
panacead start

# or by other commands depending on your environment
```

**NOTE**:
If you are using the [Cosmovisor](https://medibloc.gitbook.io/panacea-core/guide/cosmovisor) process manager, please
build the new `panacead` binary manually and put that under the `$HOME/.panacea/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.0.7/bin/` by
following the [guide](https://medibloc.gitbook.io/panacea-core/guide/cosmovisor#cosmovisor-setup). We do not support
automatic downloads for security reasons.

### Rollback Strategy

In the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord to come to a quick
emergency consensus and mitigate any further issues.

We will try to fix the issue by making a hotfix without rolling the chain back.
But, if there is no other way, we will roll the chain back to the v2.0.6 by following the steps below.

NOTE: We assume that you already backed up your `~/.panacea` directory before upgrading your node, as explained above.

1. Stop the process running.
    ```bash
    pkill panacead

    # or by other commands depending on your environment
    ```
2. Delete the new state, and recover the previous state from the backup that you made.
    ```bash
    rm -rf ~/.panacea/data
    cp -R ~/panacea-3-v2.0.6-backup/data ~/.panacea/data
    ```
3. Prepare the previous `panacead` v2.0.6 binary.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/medibloc/panacea-core
    cd panacea-core
    git checkout tags/v2.0.6
    make install

    panacead version
    # should print v2.0.6
    ```
4. Start the process with skipping the upgrade which was registered by the SoftwareUpgrade proposal.
    ```bash
    panacead start --unsafe-skip-upgrades 10196856

    # or by other commands depending on your environment
    ```
5. Check if your node produces new blocks from the height 10196857 successfully, after 2/3+ of validators complete the
   rollback.

## Note for Service Providers

Service providers do not need to change their source code which communicates with Panacea nodes, because this upgrade
does not contain any API breaking changes.
