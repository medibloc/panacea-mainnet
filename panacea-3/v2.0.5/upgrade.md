## Summary

- SoftwareUpgrade Governance Proposal: https://www.mintscan.io/medibloc/proposals/9
- The upgrade will be started on the block height 7700000 (approximately, on Monday October 24, UTC 06:00), if the voting period of the SoftwareUpgrade proposal ends with the `passed` status.
    - See countdown [here](https://www.mintscan.io/medibloc/blocks/7700000).
- Upgrade type: Soft-fork
    - The chain ID will not be changed (will be maintained as `panacea-3`).
    - The block height will not be reset.

    | |Before|After|
    |--------|-----------|-----------|
    |Panacea|[v2.0.3](https://github.com/medibloc/panacea-core/releases/tag/v2.0.3)|[v2.0.5](https://github.com/medibloc/panacea-core/releases/tag/v2.0.5)|
    |Cosmos SDK|[v0.42.11-panacea.1](https://github.com/medibloc/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.42.11-panacea.1)|[v0.45.9-panacea.1](https://github.com/medibloc/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.45.9-panacea.1)|
    |Tendermint|[v0.34.14](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/releases/tag/v0.34.14)|[v0.34.21](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/releases/tag/v0.34.21)|


## Changes

- Upgrades Cosmos SDK from v0.42.11 to v0.45.9 which contains many new features, bug fixes, and especially a [IBC security fix](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/ibc-security-advisory-dragonberry/7702).
- Removes the `x/token` module which is not used at all.

## Guides for Validators and Full-Node Operators

If this SoftwareUpgrade proposal is approved, the state machine of the `panacead` will be stopped as soon as the chain reaches to the block height 7700000.
It means that new blocks will not be produced until the `panacead` daemon is restarted with the new version.

When the state machine is stopped, you will be able to see the following error logs:
```
ERR UPGRADE "v2.0.5" NEEDED at height: 7700000:
ERR CONSENSUS FAILURE!!! err="UPGRADE \"v2.0.5\" NEEDED at height: 7700000: "
```

Then, stop your process.
```bash
pkill panacead

# or by other commands depending on your environment
```

After that, you should build a new binary as below. And, please replace the old `panacead` binary with the new one.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/medibloc/panacea-core
cd panacea-core
git checkout v2.0.5
make install

panacead version
# should print v2.0.5
```

Prior to the upgrade, validators are encouraged to take a full data snapshot. Snapshotting depends heavily on infrastructure, but generally this can be done by backing up the `~/.panacea` directory as below.<br>
**IMPORTANT**: It is critically important for validator operators to back-up the `~/.panacea/data/priv_validator_state.json` file after stopping the `panacead` process. This file is updated every block as your validator participates in consensus rounds. It is a critical file needed to prevent double-signing, in case the upgrade fails and the previous chain needs to be restarted.
```bash
cp -R ~/.panacea ~/panacea-3-v2.0.3-backup

# or, to the external storage
```

Then, you can start the `panacead` again.
```bash
panacead start

# or by other commands depending on your environment
```

**NOTE**:
If you are using the [Cosmovisor](https://medibloc.gitbook.io/panacea-core/guide/cosmovisor) process manager, please build the new `panacead` binary manually and put that under the `$HOME/.panacea/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.0.5/bin/` by following the [guide](https://medibloc.gitbook.io/panacea-core/guide/cosmovisor#cosmovisor-setup). The [auto-download](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/cosmovisor#auto-download) is not supported yet because the appropriate version of the [libwasmvm.so](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm/blob/v0.14.0/api/libwasmvm.so) must be installed as well. Instead of installing the `libwasmvm.so` separately, I would recommend you build the `panacea-core` by the guide above. Then, the `libwasmvm.so` will be installed automatically.

**NOTE**: Since Cosmos SDK v0.43, a new configuration [grpc-web](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/2582f0aab7b2cbf66ade066fe570a4622cf0b098/server/config/toml.go#L182) has been added to the `app.toml`. This configuration is enabled by default with a port 9091. If you don't want this feature, please disable it or change the port.

### Rollback Strategy

In the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord to come to a quick emergency consensus and mitigate any further issues.

We will try to fix the issue by making a hotfix without rolling the chain back.
But, if there is no other way, we will roll the chain back to the v2.0.3 by following the steps below.

NOTE: We assume that you already backed up your `~/.panacea` directory before upgrading your node, as explained above.

1. Stop the process running.
    ```bash
    pkill panacead

    # or by other commands depending on your environment
    ```
2. Delete the new state, and recover the previous state from the backup that you made.
    ```bash
    rm -rf ~/.panacea/data
    cp -R ~/panacea-3-v2.0.3-backup/data ~/.panacea/data
    ```
3. Prepare the previous `panacead` v2.0.3 binary.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/medibloc/panacea-core
    cd panacea-core
    git checkout tags/v2.0.3
    make install

    panacead version
    # should print v2.0.3
    ```
4. Start the process with skipping the upgrade which was registered by the SoftwareUpgrade proposal.
    ```bash
    panacead start --unsafe-skip-upgrades 7700000

    # or by other commands depending on your environment
    ```
5. Check if your node produces new blocks from the height 7700001 successfully, after 2/3+ of validators complete the rollback.


## Note for Service Providers

If you are using [panacea-java v2.0.1+](https://github.com/medibloc/panacea-java) or [panacea-js v2.0.2+](https://github.com/medibloc/panacea-js) library, it is not mandatory to bump the library version that you are using. Those library versions are compatible with the panacea-core v2.0.5.

However, there are some API breaking changes from the Cosmos SDK side. You can find all API breaking changes between v0.42.x and v0.45.9 from the [Cosmos SDK change log](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.9/CHANGELOG.md).

As highlights,
- The `GetTx` gRPC request returns NOT_FOUND, instead of INVALID_ARGUMENT: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/11014.
- The events from `x/bank` have been changed: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/8656.
